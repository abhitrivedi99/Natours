# Natours
It's a complete working Node Js project. In which I have used Express Js and MongoDB.

# 


**Created using  Node Js, Express, MongoDB**

#Dependencies:
- `Express`
- `Mongoose`
- `JWT`
- `bcryptjs`

For Request and Response i have used **Postman**.

Note:

- In `.env` file you have to use your own mongoose link which you can get from http://cloud.mongodb.com/.
- I have used mailtrap.io for sending mails. So Username & Password will be provided there.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
